### Settle Lah (Mobile Application - Java)

Settle Lah is a mobile application that are responsive which means that it will be able to support multiple interfaces of device and the name Settle Lah is a Malaysian slang which has a meaning of "job is done". Settle Lah is derived
from the idea that everyone can hire any services that they want quickly, safely, reliably, and most
importantly it is cost-free. In the app store, there is no proper application currently that can handle repair work according to the warranty period. This application will only be provided to new house owners with a house warranty as payment does not involve in the entire process.

Through this application, the house owner that discovered faulty workmanship will be able to report those defects through the app, and repair work will be scheduled. This app will help with providing new house owners a platform to report their problems into the application according to their housing area. Settle Lah is also a platform for admins (management team of development) to manage and to have an overview of the repair work that is requested by the house owner. Settle Lah can also enhance the user's aftersales service as they can provide better customer service through the application and the user only needs to report through the app. Finally, through the application, the developers can also check that whether the repair work being requested is under warranty or not, and if the repair work is not under the criteria of warranty, the process won't go through. The goal is to provide quality customer service and fulfill a client's request efficiently and effectively
